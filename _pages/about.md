I'm a first-year Ph.D. candidate on [Systems Engineering](www.bu.edu/eng/departments/se/) at [Boston University](www.bu.edu). My research interests lies on Real-time Data-driven Optimizaton for Complex Systems with applications on Smart Cities and focusing on Transportation Systems.  Currently I'm working with Prof. [Christos G. Cassandras](https://christosgcassandras.org) at the [CODES Lab](www.bu.edu/codes/)
